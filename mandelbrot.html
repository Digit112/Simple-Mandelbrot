			<h1 class="portfolio_header"><i>Mandelbrot</i></h1>
			
			<p>I have mentioned the Mandelbrot set many times in other writeups in the context of chaos theory, fractals, and - my favorite math term - holomorphic dynamics. Not once, however, have I written any detailed discussion of the Mandelbrot set itself or of fractals in general. This is mainly because the Mandelbrot set is a cornerstone of mathematics deserving only the most detailed and thought-out implementation, and it has been tirelessly documented by others. I hope that this page, however, will evolve into a thorough discussion of the Mandelbrot set, rendering techniques for it, and the mathematical implications behind it.</p>
			
			<h2 class="project_header"><i>A Quick Definition</i></h2>
			
			<p>As discussed elsewhere, the Mandelbrot set is defined by the iterative equation <i>Z<sub>n+1</sub> = Z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + C</i>. We start by setting <i>Z<sub>0</sub> = 0</i> and we set <i>C</i> to a complex number based on the pixel which we are attempting to render. We then calculate <i>Z<sub>1</sub></i> using the equation above. Having <i>Z<sub>1</sub></i>, we can then calculate <i>Z<sub>2</sub></i>, then <i>Z<sub>3</sub></i>, and so on. If, after iterating an infinite number of times, the value of <i>Z</i> remains finite, we say that the point <i>C</i> is inside the Mandelbrot set, and outside otherwise. Obviously, we cannot actually evaluate the equation an infinite number of times. However, if <i>Z</i> stays small for a long period of time, we can be fairly comfortable assuming that the point will stay small forever, and therefore that <i>C</i> is inside the Mandelbrot set.</p>
			
			<h2 class="project_header"><i>Some Examples</i></h2>
			
			<p>As I stated earlier, the values of these variables are complex numbers. However, the "real" numbers (that we are all familiar with) are a subset of complex numbers, so we can freely use those to simplify our examples. In doing so, we will gain the capacity to render a single horizontal slice of the Mandelbrot set. If that doesn't make sense, then bear with me, it will make sense in time.</p>
			
			<p>Let us attempt to determine whether the point <i>C = 1</i> is inside the Mandelbrot set. We recall our equation from before:</p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>n+1</sub> = Z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + C</i></p>
			
			<p>We want to calculate <i>Z<sub>1</sub></i> first, so <i>n = 0</i>, thus we rewrite the subscripts:</p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>1</sub> = Z<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + C</i></p>
			
			<p>We know that <i>Z<sub>0</sub> = 0</i> and that <i>C = 1</i>:</p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>1</sub> = 0<sup>2</sup> + 1</i></p>
			
			<p>Therefore:</p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>1</sub> = 1</i></p>
			
			<p>And we repeat with <i>n = 1</i> to find <i>Z<sub>2</sub></i>:</p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>2</sub> = Z<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + C</i></p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>2</sub> = 1<sup>2</sup> + 1</i></p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>2</sub> = 2</i></p>
			
			<p>And again with <i>n = 2</i>:</p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>3</sub> = Z<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + C</i></p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>3</sub> = 2<sup>2</sup> + 1</i></p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>3</sub> = 5</i></p>
			
			<p>And again with <i>n = 3</i>:</p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>4</sub> = Z<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> + C</i></p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>4</sub> = 5<sup>2</sup> + 1</i></p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>4</sub> = 26</i></p>
			
			<p>Continuing, we find <i>Z<sub>5</sub> = 677</i>, <i>Z<sub>6</sub> = 458330</i>, and <i>Z<sub>7</sub> &middot; 2.1 &#xb7; 10<sup>11</sup></i>. Clearly, this number is increasing rapidly and does not belong to the Mandelbrot set. What about the point <i>C = -1</i>?</p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>1</sub> = Z<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + C</i></p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>1</sub> = 0<sup>2</sup> - 1</i></p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>1</sub> = -1</i></p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>2</sub> = -1<sup>2</sup> - 1</i></p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>2</sub> = 0</i></p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>3</sub> = 0<sup>2</sup> - 1</i></p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>3</sub> = -1</i></p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>4</sub> = -1<sup>2</sup> - 1</i></p>
			
			<p><i>Z<sub>4</sub> = 0</i></p>
			
			<p>As you can see, this time we've entered into an endless loop. Clearly, <i>Z</i> will reamin finite, alternating between <i>-1</i> and <i>0</i>, forever. Therefore, <i>C = -1</i> belongs to the Mandelbrot set. But how exactly do we get those extraordinary pictures of the Mandelbrot set?</p>
			
			<h2 class="project_header"><i>An Aside on Complex Numbers</i></h2>
			
			<p>This section is dedicated to those who've never tackled the subject of imaginary or complex numbers head-on. To those individuals, I'd strongly urge you to learn them. The simplest explanation I could give is that complex numbers exist on a <i>number plane</i> that is a 2D analog of the <i>number line</i> we all learned about early on. They are also an extenstion of the real numbers, because real numbers - the ones on the number line - are embedded within the complex plane as its x-axis.</p>
			
			<p>The complex plane is the natural conclusion reached when attempting to perform algebra on complex numbers. A complex number takes the form <i>(a + bi)</i>, where <i>a</i> is called the <i>real component</i>, <i>b</i> is the <i>imaginary component</i>, and <i>i</i> is the <i>imaginary number</i>, a constant defined as the square root of <i>-1</i>. If a complex number's imaginary component is <i>0</i>, then it is a real number. If its real component is <i>0</i>, then it is an imaginary number. Imaginary numbers have the fun property that multiplying them produces a real number. Why? follow the algebra:</p>
			
			<p><i>3i &middot; 5i = 15i<sup>2</sup></i></p>
			
			<p>Remember, <i>i</i> is the square root of <i>-1</i>. Therefore, <i>i<sup>2</sup> = -1</i>. So:<p>
			
			<p><i>15i<sup>2</sup> = -15</i></p>
			
			<p>This property will be extremely useful later.</p>
			
			<p>When it comes to visualizing the complex plane, imagine a cartesian plane with an x-axis and a y-axis that form a grid. Every point on the grid is uniquely identified by a pair of coordinates, but it is also uniquely identified by a complex number. A ponts's x-coordinate becomes the real component of the complex number associated with it. The y-coordinate becomes the imaginary component. So the point <i>(2, 4)</i> represents the complex number <i>(2 + 4i)</i>. The x-axis, where the y-coordinates are always <i>0</i>, therefore consists entirely of the real numbers. In fact, it is the real number line. This is why I said that the real numbers are "embedded" in the complex plane. Similarly, the imaginary numbers are embedded in the complex plane as the y-axis.</p>
			
			<h3 class="project_header"><i>Basic Operations</i></h3>
			
			<p>Here, I will go over the relevant complex operations that we will need to render the Mandelbrot set.</p>
			
			<h4 class="project_header"><i>Addition/Subtraction</i></h4>
			
			<p>In addition and subtraction, you simply add the real and imaginary components separately, identical to vector addition/subtraction. For example:</p>
			
			<p><i>(2 + 4i) + (3 - 2i) = (5 + 2i)</i></p>
			
			<p><i>(5 - 3i) - (2 + 6i) = (3 - 9i)</i></p>
			
			<p>Generally:</p>
			
			<p><i>(a + bi) + (c + di) = ((a+c) + (b+d)i)</i></p>
			
			<p><i>(a + bi) - (c + di) = ((a-c) + (b-d)i)</i></p>
			
			<h4 class="project_header"><i>Multiplication/Squaring</i></h4>
			
			<p>In multiplication, we use FOIL (firsts, outsides, insides, lasts), just like if we were multiplying binomials:</p>
			
			<p><i>(2 + 3i) &middot; (4 + 3i) = 2&middot;4 + 2&middot;3i + 3i&middot;4 + 3i&middot;3i</i></p>
			
			<p>This simplifies to:</p>
			
			<p><i>8 + 6i + 12i + 9i<sup>2</sup></i></p>
			
			<p>And then, after combining like terms, to:</p>
			
			<p><i>8 + 18i + 9i<sup>2</sup></i></p>
			
			<p>Then we negate the final term, because <i>i<sup>2</sup> = -1</i>, and combine it with the other real term:</p>
			
			<p><i>(-1 + 18i)</i></p>
			
			<p>Generally:</p>
			
			<p><i>(a + bi) &middot; (c + di) = ((ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i)</i></p>
			
			<p>Squaring a complex number is simpler because <i>a = c</i> and <i>b = d</i>. The general equation becomes:</p>
			
			<p><i>(a + bi)<sup>2</sup> = ((a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>) + (2ab)i)</i></p>
			
			<p>An example would be:</p>
			
			<p>(3 + 2i)<sup>2</sup></p>
			
			<p><i>3&middot;3 + 3&middot;2i + 2i&middot;3 + 2i&middot;2i</i></p>
			
			<p><i>9 + 6i + 6i + 4i<sup>2</sup></i></p>
			
			<p><i>9 + 12i + 4i<sup>2</sup></i></p>
			
			<p><i>(5 + 12i)</i></p>
			
			<h4 class="project_header"><i>Absolute Value</i></h4>
			
			<p>Did you ever think it was silly of teachers to define "absolute value" as "distance from 0"? After all, it just makes negative numbers positive, right? Well, in the complex plane, this definition is perfect. The absolute value of a complex number is literally the euclidean distance from the point to <i>(0 + 0i)</i>, which is found using the pythagorean theorem.</p>
			
			<p><i>|(-3 + 4i)| = sqrt(-3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>) = 5</i></p>
			
			<p>Generally:</p>
			
			<p><i>|(a + bi)| = sqrt(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>)</i></p>
			
			<h2 class="project_header"><i>A Little Code</i></h2>
			
			<p>The methodology for rendering the Mandelbrot set is rather simple. Firstly, we take each pixel in our final image and asign it a complex number. For each pixel, we then asign that value to C and begin calculating higher and higher values of <i>Z</i>. Calculating up to <i>Z<sub>50</sub></i> is plenty for an initial render. If |Z| ever surpasses 2, then it can be proven that the point will continue expanding outwards and therefore does not belong to the Mandelbrot set. We will therefore alternate between calculating new values of <i>Z</i> and checking whether those values are too large. If the point never grows too large, we'll assume that the point belongs to the Mandelbrot set, even though it may escape if more iterations were performed. The below C++ code performs these steps and colors pixels white or black depending on their membership in the Mandelbrot set.</p>
			
			<p>Notably, I've chosen a potentially unique method of outputting the images as pgm files because writing an encoder/decoder for this image format is trivial. My code therefore does not depend on any external libraries. I view them with <a href="https://imageglass.org/">ImageGlass</a> and convert them to png's with ffmpeg as needed. The code is also very verbose and can be fairly easily streamlined.</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;cmath>
#include &lt;cstdio>
#include &lt;cstdint>

int main() {
	// Size of the image to produce
	size_t width = 1024;
	size_t height = 1024;
	
	// The maximum number of iterations to perform.
	int max_n = 50;
	
	// Reserve the memory required to hold the image.
	// new is used to prevent a stack overflow for large images.
	uint8_t* img = new uint8_t[width*height];
	
	// Iterate over all pixels
	for (int x = 0; x < width; x++) {
		for (int y = 0; y < height; y++) {
			// This pixel will be made to be black (0).
			// If the pixel is found to be outside the Mandelbrot set, we will change the color to white (255).
			img[(y*width) + x] = 0;
			
			// initialize our variables. Real and imaginary components are tracked separately.
			double Zr = 0;
			double Zi = 0;
			
			// Get C from (x, y), and get the components into the range 0-1
			double Cr = (double) x / width;
			double Ci = (double) y / height;
			
			// Get C's components into the range we want. In this case, we're using -2 to 2.
			// So, we're rendering the region of the complex plane from (-2 - 2i) to (2 + 2i).
			Cr = Cr * 4 - 2;
			Ci = Ci * 4 - 2;
			
			// Begin iterating.
			for (int n = 0; n < max_n; n++) {
				// Square Z
				double Zr_new = Zr*Zr - Zi*Zi;
				double Zi_new = 2*Zr*Zi;
				
				// Add C
				Zr_new += Cr;
				Zi_new += Ci;
				
				Zr = Zr_new;
				Zi = Zi_new;
				
				// Calculate absolute value and check for escape.
				float abs_Z = sqrt(Zr*Zr + Zi*Zi);
				if (abs_Z > 2) {
					img[(y*width) + x] = 255;
					break;
				}
			}
		}
	}
	
	// Save the resulting image  as a pgm.
	char hdr[128];
	size_t hdr_len = sprintf(hdr, "P5 %ul %ul 255 ", width, height);
	
	FILE* fout = fopen("out.pgm", "w");
	fwrite(hdr, 1, hdr_len, fout);
	fwrite(img, 1, width*height, fout);
	fclose(fout);
	
	delete[] img;
	
	return 0;
}

			<p>This produces the following image:</p>
			
			<figure style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="images/simple_mandel.png" width="60%">
			</figure>
			
			<p>Some work stands to be done. Firstly, we could stand to use a complex number class. We don't need something fully-featured, just something to simplify our code. In fact, we can have just two functions: one for squaring the number and adding another to it, and another function for retrieving its absolute value. Although, we should actually retrieve the <i>square</i> of its absolute value, because <code>sqrt()</code> is a rather costly function to be running potentially billions of times for a single, high-quality render. We'll just compare that value to the square of our escape radius, instead of what we've been doing above. The class will look like this:</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// Represents a complex number with a real component and an imaginary component.
class complex {
public:
	double r;
	double i;
	
	complex() : r(0), i(0) {}
	
	complex(double real, double imaginary) : r(real), i(imaginary) {}
	
	// Squares this complex number and then adds the passed addend to it.
	void square_and_add(const complex& addend) {
		double temp = r*r - i*i + addend.r;
		i = 2*r*i + addend.i;
		r = temp;
	}
	
	// Retrieve the square of the absolute value of this number.
	float sqr_abs() const {
		return r*r + i*i;
	}
};
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>Our initialization code for <i>Z</i> and <i>C</i> becomes:</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// Initialize Z
complex Z(0, 0);

// Initialize C
complex C((double) x / width * 4 - 2, (double) y / height * 4 - 2);
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>Our innermost <code>for-loop</code> becomes:</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// Begin iterating.
for (int n = 0; n < max_n; n++) {
	// Square Z and add C
	Z.square_and_add(C);

	// Calculate absolute value and check for escape.
	if (Z.sqr_abs() > 4) {
		img[(y*width) + x] = 255;
		break;
	}
}
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>One useful trait of the complex class is that it contains the only references to the underlying data types used to store the components to the complex numbers. If you want, you can easily swap them out for single-precision floats for a performance boost or for a more precise data type for increased zoom. You could even make the class a template to allow the underlying type to be swapped out to meet the requirements of a render.</p>
			
			<p>Next up: a camera class. Because I'm really going all-in here, I'll make a 2D transformation matrix class. This not only allows for panning and scaling but for rotation as well, and even shearing of the render area. The constructor I've included below, however, only allows the creation of a scaling-panning matrix. A more sophisticated one will be added down the line, along with many other functions that warrant exploration. A simpler camera class could basically just define a rectangle. It's most important feature is just a function that converts a pixel into the appropriate complex number.</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// A 2D transformation matrix.
class camera {
public:
	// New x and y axis, plus offset.
	complex x;
	complex y;
	complex o;
	
	// Given the width and height of the output image,
	// and the coordinates of the lower-left and upper-right corners of the region of the complex plane to render,
	// construct a transformations matrix with only scaling and translation.
	camera(size_t out_width, size_t out_height, double left, double bottom, double right, double top) :
		width(out_width), height(out_height),
		x( (right - left) / out_width, 0 ),
		y( 0, (top - bottom) / out_height ),
		o( left, bottom )
	{}
	
	// Applies the matrix to the given coordinaates, converting from pixel coordinates to complex coordinates.
	complex pixel_to_complex(int pixel_x, int pixel_y) {
		return complex(
			x.r * pixel_x + y.r * pixel_y + o.r,
			x.i * pixel_y + y.i * pixel_y + o.i
		);
	}
};
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>Next, we simply define our camera at the top of the main function. The below coordinates render the region (-2.6 - 1.181i) to (1.6 + 1.181i), which is a good region at 16:9 resolution. The output size has been changed to 1920x1080 to match this resolution as well.</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// Create a camera
camera cam(width, height, -2.6, -1.181, 1.6, 1.181);
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>Now, we simply change the initialization of <i>C</i> to use this class:</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// Initialize C
complex C = cam.pixel_to_complex(x, y);
			</code></pre>
			
			<figure style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="images/mandel_simple_2.png" width="60%">
			</figure>
			
			<p>What I'd like to do now is abstract away some more of the code in our mainloop. A fractal render requires a separate function for rendering and for coloring, and we'll separate these steps into separate processes. In order to accomplish this, we'll create an abstract fractal_calculator class that contains some functions which can be defined differently for different fractals. if you're only interested in the Mandelbrot set, this additional stepis not necessary. An array of these objects will exist in memory; one for each pixel. By doing this, we will be able to perform multiple separate passes of iterations as well as alternate between iterating and rendering so that an image can be produced procedurally.</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// Base class for a fractal calculator.
// Derivatives of this class may render different fractals.
class fractal_calculator {
public:
	unsigned int n;
	
	fractal_calculator() : n(0) {}
	
	// Iterate the equation num_n times. The function is responsible for the maintenance of the fractal_calculator::n member.
	virtual void iterate(unsigned int num_n) = 0;
	
	// Returns true if this point is beleived to be inside the fractal, false otherwise.
	virtual bool is_inside_fractal() const = 0;
};
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>A lot is going on here. We include a no-arg constructor that will be useful later, and another constructor that is meant to be overidden by subclasses.</p>
			
			<p>The iterate_to(int) function is also declared, which iterates up to a certain value of n using the previous function. This is useful if multiple passes of iteration steps are desired.</p>
			
			<p>Now, we will create the iterator_grid object.</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// Class representing a grid of fractal_iterator objects.
template<class T>
class iterator_grid {
public:
	// The camera used by this grid for rendering.
	camera cam;
	
	// The grid of fractal iterators.
	T* data;
	
	iterator_grid(const camera& grid_cam) : cam(grid_cam) {
		static_assert(std::is_base_of_v<fractal_iterator, T>, "Template parameter must derive from fractal_iterator.");
		
		// Allocate and initialize memory.
		data = (T*) malloc(cam.width*cam.height*sizeof(T));
		for (int x = 0; x < cam.width; x++) {
			for (int y = 0; y < cam.height; y++) {
				data[y*cam.width + x] = T(cam, x, y);
			}
		}
	}
	
	// Call iterate on all grid cells
	void iterate(int num_n) {
		for (int i = 0; i < cam.width*cam.height; i++) {
			data[i].iterate(num_n);
		}
	}
	
	// Call iterate_to on all grid cells
	void iterate_to(int max_n) {
		for (int i = 0; i < cam.width*cam.height; i++) {
			data[i].iterate_to(max_n);
		}
	}
	
	~iterator_grid() {
		free(data);
	}
};
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>As you can see, this is a template class requiring the template parameter to derive from fractal_iterator. It assumes that the constructor and iterate function have been defined and constructs each nobject in the grid separately. It includes functions for calling iterate() and iterate_to() and all of the cells.</p>
			
			<p>Now we initialize the iterator in the main function like so:</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// Create the iterator grid.
iterator_grid<mandelbrot_iterator> iter(cam);
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>And our for loops are removed and replaced by similar for-loops which simply color the image:</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// Iterate over all pixels
for (int x = 0; x < width; x++) {
	for (int y = 0; y < height; y++) {
		img[y*width + x] = (iter.data[y*width + x].Z.sqr_abs() > 4) * 255;
	}
}
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>We have now nearly abstracted away the entire process; only colorization remains. For this purpose, we will choose a similar inheritance model.</p>
